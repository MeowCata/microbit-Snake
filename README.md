## How to play it?
* First,you should have a micro:bit,it's a **Pocket Programming Computer**.

* Next,download the code and flash it into micro:bit

* Then,read the game instructions below carefully
> [!NOTE]
> **1.Press(Hold in v1.1+)) `Btn-B` to start after flashing**
> 
> **2.Next,tilt your micro:bit to adjust angle(*this angle is the tilt angle that allows the snake to move one block/dot*)**
>
>     the angle you chose will be displayed on the screen   if you want to continue,press `Btn-A`(press A+B in v1.1)  press `Btn-A` in v1.2+ 
> 
> **3.Play!Tilt your micro:bit to make the snake move to the food and **EAT it**. Then,look for another food!(press `Btn-A` to quit in *v1.0*,double click `Btn-B` in *v1.1*,hold `Btn-A`in *v1.2*+)**
>
> **4.If the snake moved out of the screen,that means you died**
> 
>     HOWEVER, you have 2 lives and you will "respawn(it is so-called in Minecraft)"in the middle of the screen
> 
>     BUT, because of some bugs(that were not fixed),if you were tilting when you died,the respawn point might not be in the middle
> ***you won't die again although the respawn point wasn't in the middle:) and in *v1.1* or later version, the shield will enable after respawning/spawning***
> 
>**5.If your lives were all ran out,you *died*,then you can watch the whole game replay,it shows all the food you ate and all the ways your snake *walked*(shows the score you earned in *v1.1*+, score animation only in *v1.2*+)**
> **6.Winning! only *v1.2*+ | when score>=12,show score animation(plot dots as your score) and you win!**
> 
> *this project really took a long time to make...*
>
> okay,that's all for this time | *have a nice day~*

## FeaturesðŸŽ‡
- [x] **controllable snake movement** you can use the parameter(*enabled*, called `moveEnabled` in *v1.1*+) to control whether the snake moves
- [x] **food creation & getting food**(*the food production point is at least two dots away from the snake*)
- [x] **manual tilt angle**(15Â° 20Â° ***25Â°(default)*** 30Â°, 4 feels, based on *motion sensor*)
- [x] **snake tail process & trailing effect**
- [x] **scores & lives!**(default:2 lives) score animation only *v1.2*+
- [x] **the whole game replay!** it shows how the snake moved and got food, based on *arrays*
- [x] **Ai!(only in *v1.1*+)** *double click `Btn-A` to launch*, it will automatically help you eat food(one launch for one food **:D**)
- [x] **Shield!(only in *v1.1*+)** **if the remainder of the score divided by 3 is 0** or **score equals to 0**, you won't die(move out of the screen) until your score changed| enable shield after respawning(in v1.2+)
### PitiesðŸ˜­
- [ ] Snake lengthening. However, an lengthened snake will block the screen, and micro:bit only has an `5x5 LED screen`
- [ ] Obstacles. the snakes loses one *live* when it touches them, but it's hard to tell which bright spots(dots) are food and which are obstacles

## FunctionsðŸŽ²
* **Start:** press `Btn-B` in v1.0, hold `Btn-B` in v1.1 and v1.2
* **Adjust the Angle:** hold `Btn-A` in both v1.0&v1.1, removed in v1.2&1.3
* **Stop:** press `Btn-A` in v1.0, double click `Btn-B` in v1.1, hold `Btn-A` in v1.2&v1.3
* **Ai(only in *v1.1*+):** double click `Btn-A`
