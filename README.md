open-sourced snake game based on **micro-bit**

made by a *middle school student: [DingDang](https://github.com/MeowCata)*

**Please follow the open-source protocol! *Enjoy!***

## How to play it?
* First,you should have a micro:bit,it's a **Pocket Programming Computer**.

* Next,download the code and flash it into micro:bit

* Then,read the game instructions below carefully
> [!NOTE]
> **1.Press `Btn-B` to start after flashing**
> 
> **2.Next,tilt your micro:bit to adjust angle(*this angle is the tilt angle that allows the snake to move one block/dot*)**
>
>     the angle you chose will be displayed on the screen   if you want to continue,press `Btn-A`
> 
> **3.Play!Tilt your micro:bit to make the snake move to the food and **EAT it**. Then,look for another food!**
>
> **4.If the snake moved out of the screen,that means you died**
> 
>     HOWEVER, you have 2 lives and you will "respawn(it is so-called in Minecraft)"in the middle of the screen
> 
>     BUT, because of some bugs(that were not fixed),if you were tilting when you died,the respawn point might not be in the middle
> ***you won't die again although the respawn point wasn't in the middle:)***
> 
>**5.If your lives were all ran out,you *died*,then you can watch the whole game replay,it shows all the food you ate and all the ways your snake *walked***
> 
> *this function really took a long time to make...*
>
> okay,that's all for this time | *let me have a good rest~*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> my micro:bit ver is 2.21 so I can't test my code on an elder version,*but the simulator shows that the code works:)*
